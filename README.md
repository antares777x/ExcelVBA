# ExcelVBA

I'm storing all of my Excel macros that I make in this repository.  I'm trying to keep them separated by function, so work.bas will include the subroutines that I use at work.  I'll have another document for the macros I use to organize my MTG card collection, and probably a third that will be for other miscellaneous macros for personal use.
